To build this locally, just change to this directory and call `make`

To build and install this for an OpenWRT target, follow this receipe.
It uses OpenWRT cloned to jobawrt directory and builds an ipk package
in a local feed at ~/openwrt-feed/net/ethic

```
# prepare the openwrt toolchain, e.g. here in jobawrt
cd ~/git/jobawrt
make toolchain/install

# prepare feed and package
mkdir -p ~/openwrt-feed/net/ethic

# use the template Makefile in the openwrt folder
vi ~/openwrt-feed/net/ethic/Makefile
echo "src-link joba $HOME/openwrt-feed" >>feeds.conf
./scripts/feeds update joba
./scripts/feeds install -a -p joba

# configure package as module or builtin to a firmware
make menuconfig

# compile the app
make package/ethic/compile

# check the results
ls -la bin/packages/aarch64_cortex-a53/joba/

# install the app to a running target ax1
scp bin/packages/aarch64_cortex-a53/joba/ethic_1.0-1_aarch64_cortex-a53.ipk ax1:/tmp
ssh ax1 ipkg install /tmp/ethic_1.0-1_aarch64_cortex-a53.ipk

# see it running
ssh ax1 ethic -h
```
